Find workflow numbers

```
runTheMatrix.py -n -w 2017
```

Input files from:

```
runTheMatrix.py -w 2017 -l 10024.0
```

This creates the necessary python files, and runs a small sample. When
you have the python files, add the pythia8 settings into the step1
GENSIM file.

Then, copy pythia xml from PYTHIA8DATA setup by CMS, change Vtq
min/max and set (with /your/ pythia xml directory):

```
export SRT_PYTHIA8DATA_SCRAMRTDEL=/home/iwatson/CMSSW_9_4_0/src/pythia-xml
export PYTHIA8DATA=/home/iwatson/CMSSW_9_4_0/src/pythia-xml
```

and then run the python files step by step throguh cmsRun (*dont run
the cmsDriver.py commands*, it overwrites the input files and you'll
have to add the pythia8 settings back)
